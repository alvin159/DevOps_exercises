The containers use virtual network interfaces (indicated by the networks listed in docker-status.txt) to communicate with the host and each other. Each container also maintains its own filesystem, providing isolation while still allowing for shared resources where configured. The bridge network allows the services to communicate internally, while Service 1 exposes its HTTP interface to the outside world via port mapping.
